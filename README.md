## Welcome to my Side Projects Page

Here you will find information, links, notes on the side projects I am working on. Its for the purpose of my book keeping but I hope someone out there also benefits from it.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kivijoshi/SideProjectsInfo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
